so much for today 's work .
the automobile is of great use in our life .
i remember hearing the story once .

all of the students were present .
come and have tea with me .
the fact is known to everybody .
could i get a japanese newspaper , please ?
we still have enough time to discuss it .
what is it that you really want to say ?
does she work in this city ?
his speech continued for three hours .
he opened the door .
she came down to breakfast at eight .

and spent that day with him .
she came an hour beyond the appointed time .

his father calls him tom .
do you want to go to dinner today ?

popular or not , it is right .
there is little furniture in my house .
i have a great deal to do today .
he is employed in a bank .
he arrived two days previously .
he worked hard in order to get the prize .

traveling by sea is a lot of fun .

i am not sure but she may come .
this is much the better of the two .
whose books are those ?
he likes to walk about in the park .
he has a large number of books .
he is more gentle than kind .
can you see fish swimming in the water ?
please tell me your name .
they are all in arms .
i am paid 10 dollars an hour .
that has no bearing on our plan .
the thing is , i don 't really want to .
in times like this , there 's nothing like a hair of the dog .
he is much taller than i am .
there was a fire near the train station last night .
my son is now as tall as i am .
even children can read this book .
he didn 't give me anything to eat .
i feel very feverish .
he abstained from smoking .
i nearly made a mistake .
let 's reserve that for another occasion .
please reserve this table for us .
at last he found out the truth .
i stayed at a hotel on a hill in that town .
i don 't know for certain when he will come .
i want to live in comfort .
i 'm counting on you .
he turned to his friends for help .
what would you do , if you had a million dollars ?
she is my dream girl .
i think it important to tell him the facts .
since it was raining , we stayed at home .
i can 't see what you mean .

i have no particular reason to do so .
he came running .
is it hard to speak english ?
i like coffee very much .
he is very close with his money .
suddenly , a good idea occurred to me .
won 't you come to my house next sunday ?
old mr smith is saving as much money as he can .
how about the taste ?
please tell me what happened to him .
suffice it to say that , after all , this won 't do .
most boys like computer games .
you may take either half of the cake .
i often run into her at the supermarket .
up against the wall !
i found it difficult to understand what he was saying .
i have heard the story .
she regarded the story as a joke .
we had a very good time last night .
i looked for the key .
i made this kennel by myself .

i think that they will be late .
i was able to catch the last train .

that 's right , isn 't it ?
i think his life is in danger .
it is yet to be seen whether this plan will succeed or not .
homework must be done by tomorrow .
he held out his hand .
we looked , but saw nothing .
have him wait a moment .
he is in want of money .
they were on board the same airplane .
in the first place , we must be careful about what we eat and drink .
the dress comes to my knees .
why are you crying ?
he became the company president when he was thirty .
my older brother is a teacher .
i 'm twice your age .
she turned pale at the news .
the game will be called off if it rains tomorrow .
i met my classmate .
can you stand on your hands ?
i would like you to make tea for me .
she keeps her diary in english .
having walked for sometime , we came to the lake .
i 'm sorry , but he is out now .
i went there to meet him .
i wish there was more variety in my work .
the doctor has saved my life .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
this is an interesting story .
the dog looked into the water .
to change the subject .
don 't worry about the work .
what he says is true to some extent .
you are quite in the wrong .
has father come home yet ?
you don 't need to go in such a hurry .
i have met her before .
so you 've got to be a believer .
are you going to learn english ?
she is an earnest student .
no , i did it on my own account .
please choose between this one and that one .
he knows whatever .
in brief , i need money . please lend it to me !
he walked two miles in half an hour .
i will study abroad when i have finished school .
we should wait here for the moment .
i found him at his books .
he is a good loser .
don 't give up if you fail .
the rain kept us from going out .
what animal is it ?
she began to talk to the dog .
we have a lot of work to do .
i arrived just in time for the plane .
what subjects are you taking at school ?
we are dependent on each other .
i 'm not too clear about that point .
she came out with some strange tunings .
let 's make believe we have one million yen hand .
i could not make myself heard in the noisy class .
by god , i 'll finish this homework .
i haven 't seen him lately .
i don 't like him because he loses his temper easily .
he is master of this house .
he is a gentleman .
may i speak with you ?
the game exhausted me .
quiet down , please .
i did not watch tv but studied english last night .
let 's get started right away .
he was running and calling for help .
this is the most difficult book i have ever read .
the meeting broke up at eight .
i was late because of heavy traffic .
i paid him a visit yesterday .
it is really quite a good story .
every house had a garden .
i 'm freezing .
mary prided herself on her beauty .
we arrived on the morning of the seventh .
i don 't know what to do .
she is good-natured .
where is my seat ?
such a thing can 't happen in japan .
she could not refrain from tears .
why don 't i try to do something about the garden ?
for example , do you like english ?
the garden was filled with flowers .
i do not read his novels .
i don 't want any sandwiches .
how well she is singing !
his opinion is quite different from ours .
it seems that we have lost our way .
she came across the street .
the fact is that he slept late that morning .
this hotel does not take dogs .
there is no denying the fact .
i bought a good camera .

she was intent on her book .
i am looking forward to seeing you .
we came upon them in new york .
i telephoned to make sure that he was coming .
it is surprising that you should know her name .
he returned from abroad yesterday .
this fish is not fit to eat .
his house was built of logs .
it was inevitable that they would meet .

nothing is more important than health .
she has no more than 100 dollars .
many students took part in the contest .
i 'll be back by seven or eight o 'clock .
for the love of heaven , don 't get angry .
i didn 't catch what he said .
he is likely to come .
i had to vary my plan .
the condition seems to be bad recently .
he turned over the matter in his mind .
he answered that he knew no french .
the room has been empty for a long time .
she carried this table by herself .
my mother is always busy .
you will find the scene just as you see it in this picture .
he returned to america .
i 'm afraid it 's not a good idea .
the girl whose mother is ill is absent today .
i 'll go no matter what .
who built it ?
she is having coffee now .
these two are widely different from each other .
i will remember your kindness for good .
you cannot climb !
put it on my father 's account .
where is the toilet ?

i was invited to her birthday party .
he can speak both english and french .
enough tv , already !
i wonder why he was absent .
the heavy rain kept us from going out .
that 's a hard question to answer .
our school library has many books .
they are about the same age .
i will go , provided the weather is clear .
you are stupid .
would you like to come along ?
mother washes every day .
i believe that he is honest .
this is the most beautiful sight that i have ever seen .
do you hold him in great account ?
you 'd better go in person .
how did you come by those rare books ?
he fell off the horse .
that woman stays young .
there was nothing but the ocean as far as the eye could see .
i will be at your house at eight .
i quite agree to your proposal .
what you said is , in a sense , true .
she always looks happy .
this is what i was waiting for .
i cannot fancy going out in this weather .
i 'll get there before you will .
she told her son to wait a minute .
may i use this telephone ?

the baby wept to sleep .
she turned pale at the news .
everybody was jealous of my success .
i 'll try not to make mistakes next time .

how was your stay ?
summer has come .
i 'm not fond of her face .
i 'm really tired today .
he is a student who i am teaching english this year .
don 't lean too much on others .
those tears are artificial .
even a little child knows its name .
how far are you going ?
we played cards last night .
don 't forget to bolt the door .
the coat has worn well .
he came down in the world .
what is she about ?
which of your parents do you take after ?
the question is who will go there for him .
he is not the shy boy he used to be .
how long can i keep this book ?
the light was on in the room .
meg didn 't even look at me .
i have no more than one thousand yen .
she loves her children .

you are kind to say so .
the light is out .
his paper is far from satisfactory .
we ought to leave now .
the dream has come true .

what did you come here so early for ?
he will love her forever .
you are not coming , are you ?
he ran the risk of having an accident .
you must not park the car in this street .
if i were in your situation , i would do the same thing .
you need not have come so early .
i can 't speak french .
we have five days to go before the summer vacation .
he knows almost nothing about that animal .
how did he take the news ?
he can 't speak much english .
i called him this morning .
her story was not interesting .
not having a telephone is an inconvenience .
i 'd like to borrow fifty dollars from you .
the hotel has a good prospect .
even i can 't believe that .
may i try it on ?
i usually have breakfast at seven .
there is one big difference .
they first met on a summer afternoon .
the country was wasted by war .
there is more money than is needed .
it was not long before she came .
the whole town knows about it .

her grammar is bad .
how long does it take by bus ?
the boy is kind .

she has changed greatly since i last saw her .
i waited for him for an hour .
there seem to be several reasons for that .
what time does the last tokyo train leave ?
he was looked up to by all his friends .
because it rained , i didn 't go .
it is no more than ten minutes ' walk from here .
he gets angry over trivial things .
i found it difficult to put it into practice .
that was no ordinary storm .
i should not have said that .
he is good at tennis .
we took his success for granted .
how long is that story ?
don 't put your hands out of the window .
what are the visiting hours ?
i visited him once in a while .
he had his only son killed in the war .
you can speak as you actually feel .
set the clock right . it 's ten minutes fast .
we understand the necessity of studying .
what do you conclude from that ?
i 'm much better today than yesterday .
he turned away the question .
come and help us .
you must be the temporary we asked for .
oh , you 're going home tonight !
he has decided not to go to the meeting .
why don 't you rest a bit ?
put the gun on the table .
who made this plan ?
he was at work till late at night .
a trip to the riviera should do you good .
my father and i played tennis on sunday .
my father gave a nice watch to me .
a doctor was called in right away .

i am afraid i must be going now .
he can drive a car .
can you check if the phone is out of order ?
ten to one he will succeed .
my father used to go to work by bus .
i can 't sleep at night .
he turned around .
fish have ceased to live in this river .
a piano is expensive , but a car is more expensive .
i will be happy to attend your party .
i will meet you off the train tomorrow .
would you care for a drink ?
thank you very much for your hospitality .
he accepted my idea .
can you find the time to play with our daughter ?
all right . i 'll come as soon as possible .
i could not come up to his expectations .
he goes abroad every year .
my toothache returned in a few hours .
i don 't work on sunday .
i tried everything to keep him alive .
this river is very dangerous to swim in .
let 's go back before it begins to rain .
he was not aware of the danger .
why don 't you call him up ?
i am leaving for tokyo tomorrow .
because it was summer vacation , i took a trip .

it 's awfully cold today .
i feel like taking a walk now .
he is rich enough to buy that car .
the best thing is to telephone her .
i don 't mind getting up at six .
i am to meet him at five at the station .
while staying in tokyo , i came to know her .
i took her for an american .
she married him for the sake of his family name .

he is popular with the people at large .
they confronted each other .
could you put it in plain language ?
it soon began to rain very hard .
you boob ! i should not have asked you .
i 'm sorry for your not having come with us .
we had a lot of fun at the skating .
the exhibition is well worth a visit .
may i take a shower in the morning ?
i 'm very sleepy today , too .
it 's not just you , i am also to blame .
why are you crying ?
have you finished ?
even a child knows right from wrong .

we are watching tv .
we are all anxious about your health .
he nodded to me .
a number of books were stolen .
mother went to town to get some bread .
there wasn 't a single book in the room .

once i lived in osaka .
you should always tell the truth .
our train was an hour late because of the heavy snow .
i don 't know who he is .
she pondered the question for a while .
are you ready to order now ?
you should be kind to others .
he must have seen it .
in fact , i was there .
now i must go about my work .
you must consider it before you answer .
we carried out that plan .
not a word did she say to me .
i live about an hour from the station .

i have heard nothing from him since then .
say with one 's own lips .
you are right to a certain extent .
peace will come to us in time .
he seems to know the secret .
it is up to you to decide what to do .
the woman who came here yesterday is miss yamada .
we used to meet on our way to school .
i like soccer best .

that is the way things went for a while .
they didn 't tell me so .
let the problem alone .
he was playing with a toy .
can i borrow your radio ?
he sees everything in terms of money .
he passed among the crowd .
how does this bear on my future ?
i was not aware of his presence .

it is impossible to put the plan into practice .
words failed me .
the best is best cheap .
there 's no soap .

i 'd like to have dinner with you .
i 'm very sorry i came home so late .
i walked along the main street .
the girl went to sleep .

i went to the airport to meet my father .
he went out for a walk with his dog .
slow down or you 're going to work yourself sick .
they worked hard day and night .
he was no longer dependent on his parents .
the little boy is afraid of the dark .
it was nice and cool there .
he was bewildered on that day .
when the bus came , she got on .
you are a good cook .
i turned to him for advice .
this will bring you to grief .
do you have a vision of your future ?
he is ashamed to ask questions .
they seem to make nothing of the problem .
either of them is honest .
this dictionary is by far the best .
alice has had a cold since last sunday .
shall we take this outside ?
i heard someone scream .
would you like to come in for an interview next week ?

it doesn 't matter whether he agrees or not .
he commanded us to work hard .
i didn 't believe him at first .

you should have accepted his advice .
we agreed to his suggestions .
my wife is a good manager .
his account of the accident accords with yours .
